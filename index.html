			<h1 class="h1index">CRISTIAN RUS<span class="blinking-cursor">|</span></h1>
		

			<p>Designing and writing about technology and how it influences society and human behaviour. My goal is to communicate and find solutions from a design perspective to how we interact in an ethical way. Currently working for <a href="https://www.webedia-group.com">Webedia</a> at <a href="https://www.xataka.com/autor/cristian-rus">Xataka</a>. If you stalk me on the Internet you will find more collaborations that I made for different companies and brands.</p>
			
			<!--<h2>_Reach me on Twitter</h2>
			<p>I'm usually active on <a href="https://twitter.com/CristianRus4">my Twitter account</a>. It's complicated to reach me in any other social network.</p>-->
				
			<h2 class="h2index">Write me an email</h2>
			<p>If you have something to tell me the most effective way it's <a href="mailto:cristianrus@hey.com">by mail</a>. To write me securely you can check my PGP key <a href="https://keybase.io/CristianRus4">on Keybase</a>. The chances to answer you on any social network are close to zero.</p>

			<p>This is brought to you from –the always beautiful– Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
