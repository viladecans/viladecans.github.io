<p>To lay the logarithmic spiral on<br>
Sea-shell and leaf alike, and see it fit,<br>
To watch the same idea work itself out<br>
In the fighter pilot’s steepening, tightening turn<br>
Onto his target, setting up the kill,<br>
And in the flight of certain wall-eyed bugs<br>
Who cannot see to fly straight into death<br>
But have to cast their sidelong glance at it<br>
And come but cranking to the candle’s flame</p>

<p>How secret that is, and how privileged<br>
One feels to find the same necessity<br>
Ciphered in forms diverse and otherwise<br>
Without kinship &#8212 that is the beautiful<br>
In nature as in art, not obvious,<br>
Not inaccessible, but just between.</p>

<p>It may diminish some our dry delight<br>
To wonder if everything we are and do<br>
Lies subject to some little law like that;<br>
Hidden in nature, but not deeply so.</p>
