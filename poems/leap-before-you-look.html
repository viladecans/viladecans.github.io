<p>The sense of danger must not disappear:<br>
The way is certainly both short and steep,<br>
However gradual it looks from here;<br>
Look if you like, but you will have to leap.</p>

<p>Tough-minded men get mushy in their sleep<br>
And break the by-laws any fool can keep;<br>
It is not the convention but the fear<br>
That has a tendency to disappear.</p>

<p>The worried efforts of the busy heap,<br>
The dirt, the imprecision, and the beer<br>
Produce a few smart wisecracks every year;<br>
Laugh if you can, but you will have to leap.</p>

<p>The clothes that are considered right to wear<br>
Will not be either sensible or cheap,<br>
So long as we consent to live like sheep<br>
And never mention those who disappear.</p>

<p>Much can be said for social savoir-faire,<br>
But to rejoice when no one else is there<br>
Is even harder than it is to weep;<br>
No one is watching, but you have to leap.</p>

<p>A solitude ten thousand fathoms deep<br>
Sustains the bed on which we lie, my dear:<br>
Although I love you, you will have to leap;<br>
Our dream of safety has to disappear.</p>
