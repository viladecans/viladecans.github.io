<p>The trees are in their autumn beauty,<br>
The woodland paths are dry,<br>
Under the October twilight the water<br>
Mirrors a still sky;<br>
Upon the brimming water among the stones<br>
Are nine-and-fifty swans.</p>

<p>The nineteenth autumn has come upon me<br>
Since I first made my count;<br>
I saw, before I had well finished,<br>
All suddenly mount<br>
And scatter wheeling in great broken rings<br>
Upon their clamorous wings.</p>

<p>I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,<br>
And now my heart is sore.<br>
All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,<br>
The first time on this shore,<br>
The bell-beat of their wings above my head,<br>
Trod with a lighter tread.</p>

<p>Unwearied still, lover by lover,<br>
They paddle in the cold<br>
Companionable streams or climb the air;<br>
Their hearts have not grown old;<br>
Passion or conquest, wander where they will,<br>
Attend upon them still.</p>

<p>But now they drift on the still water,<br>
Mysterious, beautiful;<br>
Among what rushes will they build,<br>
By what lake's edge or pool<br>
Delight men's eyes when I awake some day<br>
To find they have flown away?</p>
