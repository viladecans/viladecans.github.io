<p>He stands there speaking without love<br>
Of theories where, in the democracy<br>
Of this universe, or that,<br>
There could be legislators<br>
Who ordain trajectories for falling bodies,<br>
Where all things must be dreamed with indifference,<br>
And purpose is a momentary silhouette<br>
Backlit by a blue anthropic flash,<br>
A storm on the horizon.</p>

<p>But even the painting on the wall behind,<br>
Itself an accident of shattered symmetries,<br>
Is only half eclipsed by his transparencies<br>
Of hierarchy and order,<br>
And the history of thought.</p>

<p>And what he cannot see is this:<br>
Himself projected next to his projections<br>
Where the colours from the painting<br>
Have spilled onto his shirt,<br>
Their motion stilled into a rigorous<br>
Design of lines and light.</p>
