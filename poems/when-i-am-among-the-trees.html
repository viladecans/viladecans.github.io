<p>When I am among the trees,<br>
especially the willows and the honey locust,<br>
equally the beech, the oaks and the pines,<br>
they give off such hints of gladness.</p>

<p>I would almost say that they save me, and daily.</p>

<p>I am so distant from the hope of myself,<br>
in which I have goodness, and discernment,<br>
and never hurry through the world<br>
but walk slowly, and bow often.</p>

<p>Around me the trees stir in their leaves<br>
and call out, "Stay awhile."<br>
The light flows from their branches.</p>

<p>And they call again, "Itâ€™s simple," they say,<br>
"and you too have come<br>
into the world to do this, to go easy, to be filled<br>
with light, and to shine."<br>
to you.</p>
