			<h1>Hereafter</h1>
			
			<p>Hereafter is a web tool for sending letters to the future and receiving them from the past. Therefore, the main objective of this project was to facilitate the writing and reading of the letters. </p>

			<p>In this project, we bet on a unique dark design where the text predominates to generate that sought-after writing and reading environment.</p>

			<p>As expected, this is a totally responsive website where the elements are adapted to the different sizes of the screen where it is used. Always the same content, no matter how small the screen is.</p>

			<p>The typography and the use of different sizes allow to easily distinguish and structure the content. In addition, part of the text is predefined so that regardless of the content of the letter, consistent design is maintained.</p>

			<p>The letter form clearly asks for the basic data to generate the letter and makes it clear when and how the letter will be sent in the future. </p>

			<p>This design adapts to different screen sizes, such as tablets, where it seeks to take advantage of all the extra size that is not available on a mobile phone by changing the position of the items. In desktop, for example, the content is divided into two large columns as a book.</p>

			<p>The colour palette is extremely simple, with only two options. Also, a single serif font is used, structured in different sizes to create clear compositions.</p>
